        <h2>1. <em>My link is not recognized, why?</em></h2>

        <p>
            The list of supported services is limited by content of
            <a href="/to/oniontree/9df6773f0b">OnionTree</a> &ndash;
            an open source repository of Tor hidden services.
            Your best shot at making vworp! support a new service is to
            have it included in OnionTree.
        </p>

        <h2>2. <em>What's a preview link?</em></h2>

        <p>
            A preview link is a link that requires user's interaction before it redirects. You
            can recognize them by ?preview at the end.
        </p>

        <h2>3. <em>All mirrors are offline.</em></h2>

        <p>
            vworp! is unable to redirect you to the service because all of the service's mirrors are
            down. Try again later.
